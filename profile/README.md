## Welcome to <b>FEWD-1212</b>.

<b>What this course IS:</b>

A hands-on intro to the basics of front-end web development. This course is great for up-skilling or jumping into web development to see if it's something you may want to pursue further. You will learn all about core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals and how to apply them at work or in your personal projects. We'll then take those new skills, and apply them more broadly to a popular library called React so you can get practice utlizing those skills in more real-world cases. We <i>will</i> get into concepts such as responsive design, DOM manipulation, JavaScript events, and scope.

<b>What this course IS NOT:</b>

An in-depth course on website design/deployment or complex and/or advanced JavaScript concepts. This is not a course that proports to make you job-ready for a role in software engineering or front-end web development. GA has other great resources for that. We <i>will not</i> cover concepts such as advanced object oriented programming, "this", prototypical inherticance, context, unit testing, recursion, bind(), call(), apply(), generators, or fetch().
